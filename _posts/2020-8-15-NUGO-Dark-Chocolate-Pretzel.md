title: NUGO Dark Chocolate Pretzel Protein Bar
---

Rating & Review by: Rina  

This bar slapped. I don't think I'll ever get tired of the taste. Unlike most other protein bars, it had a distinct saltiness to it, as promised by the pretzel flavor. As usual, the crunch factor and dark chocolate coating were gr9. Definitely one of my favorites. Would recommend.
