title: NUGO Dark Mocha Chocolate Protein Bar
---

Rating & Review by: Rina  

This one is my all-time favorite. The crunch factor was simply immaculate, a common denominator of Nugo Dark chocolate bars. The dark chocolate coating was lovely. The fragrant mocha flavor was unmistakable with every bite. Never before have I ever tasted such perfection in a protein bar. This one for sure passed the vibe check.
