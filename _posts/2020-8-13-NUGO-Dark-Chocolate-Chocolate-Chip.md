title: NUGO Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chip Protein bar
---

This one was absolutely epic. The crunch factor was simply immaculate, just like in all other Nugo Dark chocolate bars. The dark chocolate coating was beautiful. In the wise words of Jacob Pan, this bar had a "nice blend of chocolate chips and just general protein bar-ness." "Only thing missing was the coffee flavor lmpo." - Rina
Overall a very op bar!
